Is that shit a prime?

Determine whether an `int32` number is a prime.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuxiaoyuan0406/is_prime.git
cd is_prime
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j`nproc`
./is_prime <number>
```

**Note: An `int32` number lies between $-2^{31}$ and $2^{31}-1$ (or $-2147483648$ and $2147483647$).**
